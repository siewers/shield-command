## Nvidia Shield Manager project guide for agents

### Coding conventions
- Target framework `net10.0` with nullable and implicit usings enabled. Keep Core types dependency-free beyond the BCL.
- Preserve layered boundaries: Core contains models, services, and platform logic (ADB); UI handles presentation with MVVM. The UI layer references Core, never the reverse.
- MVVM with CommunityToolkit.Mvvm — use `[ObservableProperty]`, `[RelayCommand]`, and `partial void OnXChanged` for property change reactions.
- Avalonia UI with compiled bindings enabled by default. Use `x:DataType` on views.
- LiveCharts2 (`LiveChartsCore.SkiaSharpView.Avalonia`) for time-series charting.
- Keep one top-level type per file. Nested types are fine within their parent.
- Prefer the latest .NET language/runtime features where appropriate.
- Use trailing commas in multi-line initializers, parameter lists, and collection expressions to simplify diffs.
- Do not use private properties. Use private fields for stored state and private methods for computed values.
- Store the actual dependency you need, not an intermediary object you repeatedly drill into.
- Actively reduce duplication when introducing repetitive code. Consider whether shared abstractions can eliminate repetition structurally rather than just hiding it behind a helper method.
- Avoid instantiating objects inline when passing them to methods; assign to a variable first.

### Code comments
- Never use emoji icons in code, documentation, commit messages, or any project artifacts.
- Do not add comments that simply state "generated by AI" or similar attributions.

### Commit messages
- Do not include `Co-Authored-By` attribution lines in commit messages.
- Use simple `git commit -m "message"` — do not use heredocs.
